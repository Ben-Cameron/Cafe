            Raccoons (Procyon lotor) are medium-sized mammals native to North America. They are easily recognizable by their distinctive black "mask" around their eyes and their ringed tails. Raccoons have thick, grey fur and a stocky build, with an average weight of around 10-20 pounds.

        <p>Raccoons are primarily nocturnal and are known for their cleverness and adaptability. They are omnivores, which means they eat both plants and animals. Their diet can include everything from fruits and vegetables to insects, small mammals, and even carrion.

            Raccoons are also known for their dexterity and intelligence. They have been observed using tools, such as using sticks to probe for food, and are able to remember solutions to complex problems for up to three years. Raccoons are also excellent climbers and swimmers, which allows them to navigate a wide range of environments.
